        The Engineering Building is a concrete and glass, five-story building
        located on SW 4th Avenue just south of the Fourth Avenue Building and
        City of Portland Development Tower. The basement of the Engineering
        Building pre-dates its construction and is actually part of the Fourth
        Avenue Building. Designed by the architectural firm, Zimmer Gunsul
        Frasca, the Engineering Building was completed in early 2006.
